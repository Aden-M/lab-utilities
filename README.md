This is a **modified version** of the **Texas A&M "interactive_cnc.py"** script that is used for moving the CNC head around the volume of the Visualization Studio Space. 

There are **significant improvements** to the **flexibility of motion** within the CNC Space.
There are three different sessions offered by this program:
**1.** Default: Fixed Procession through Axes (X > Y > Z)
**2.** Custom Direction order: User-Chosen Fixed Procession through Axes (Any order of X,Y,Z)
**3.** Custom Direction order and cyclable axes: User-Chosen Flexible Procession through the Axes (Any order of X,Y,Z)

Session 3 Allows for movement back and forth between axes, which is immensely useful for determining coordinate
location of lab equipment.
